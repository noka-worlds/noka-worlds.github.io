### Welcome to **NOKA WORLDS** ... 

I had started learning CS - related topic from 2022 January.

After spending few month in Leetcode and some time in coursera and linkedin learning. I feel like I am too far to be a good enough SWE. That's why I am here to learn more about CS fundamental.

Disclaimer: Even this are "CS FUNDAMENTAL" , actually most of the course are not that basic ... This might be due to it is a "FUNDAMENTAL" course for top-tier university students like MIT, STANFORD, CMU, UCB, etc

### Rerference: 

Most of the course and this path are gathered from [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) and [CS自学指南]([csdiy.wiki](https://csdiy.wiki/))

### Quote - Why learn computer science 



>Why learn computer science?

>There are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high level tools. 

>Both call themselves software engineers, and both tend to earn similar salaries in their early careers. But Type 1 engineers progress toward more fulfilling and well-remunerated work over time, whether that’s valuable commercial work or breakthrough open-source projects, technical leadership or high-quality individual contributions.


>Type 1 engineers find ways to learn computer science in depth, whether through conventional means or by relentlessly learning throughout their careers. Type 2 engineers typically stay at the surface, learning specific tools and technologies rather than their underlying foundations, only picking up new skills when the winds of technical fashion change.

>Currently, the number of people entering the industry is rapidly increasing, while the number of CS grads is relatively static. This oversupply of Type 2 engineers is starting to reduce their employment opportunities and keep them out of the industry’s more fulfilling work. Whether you’re striving to become a Type 1 engineer or simply looking for more job security, learning computer science is the only reliable path.
