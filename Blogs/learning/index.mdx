import roadmap from '@site/Blogs/learning/roadmap.jpg';

Welcome to my study blog 2.0. You could not find the 1.0 version now as I had achieve it haha.

I had started learning CS - related topic from 2023 January. Originally, I was using this blog to put my notes, and my solution to all problem set, and sooner or later, I find out it is just too time consuming for me to go through every lecture and jot notes related to it. then I decided to change to a lab-project based approach.
