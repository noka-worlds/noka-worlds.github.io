#### 3.1 register variable

There are not big difference for (a)(b), But a faster iteration for (c)

Answer: The observed results suggest that storing some variables in a register vs. in memory
may or may not impact performance. In particular, storing a, b, and c in registers do not
appear to improve the performance at all, while storing n in a register improves performance
by a factor of 3.

#### 3.2 extern and
