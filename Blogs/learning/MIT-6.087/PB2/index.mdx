#### 2.1 Determine the size,minimum and maximum value following data types. Please specify if your machine is 32 bit or 64 bits in the answer.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <float.h>

int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   char a ;
   unsigned char b;
   short s;
   int i;
   unsigned int j;
   long l;
   unsigned long k;
   float f;

   double out_char = sizeof(a);
   double out_us_char = sizeof(b);
   double out_short = sizeof(s);
   double out_integer = sizeof(i);
   double out_us_integer = sizeof(j);
   double out_long = sizeof(l);
   double out_us_long = sizeof(k);
   double out_float = sizeof(f);

   printf("size of char :%f\n",out_char);
   printf("size of unsigned char :%f\n",out_us_char);
   printf("size of short :%f\n",out_short);
   printf("size of integer :%f\n",out_integer);
   printf("size of unsigned integer :%f\n",out_us_integer);
   printf("size of long :%f\n",out_long);
   printf("size of unsigned long :%f\n",out_us_long);
   printf("size of float :%f\n",out_float);

   return 0;
}
```
The code gives the following output
```
size of char :1.000000
size of unsigned char :1.000000
size of short :2.000000
size of integer :4.000000
size of unsigned integer :4.000000
size of long :4.000000
size of unsigned long :4.000000
size of float :4.000000
```

#### 2.2 Write logical expressions that tests whether a given character variable ` c ` is

- **lower case letter :** (c>='a' && c<='z')
- **upper case letter :** (c>='A' && c<='Z')
- **digit :** (c>=0 && c<=9)
- **white space (includes space,tab,new line):** (c==' ' || c=='t' || c=='\n')

#### Problem 2.3
**Consider int val=0xCAFE; Write expressions using bitwise operators that do the following:**

To Solve this question, you need to have more knowledge than that single slide to solve the questions.
Here are 3 video which I recommended you to watch and understand it before you solve this question.

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLcQyOy73c0
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hnLMnid1M0

- ** test if at least three of last four bits (LSB) are on**

LSB is an additional information here which does not affect the result.

First,extract the last four bit 
```c
int last4_bits = 0x000F & val
```
Then find is the last four bit having 3 on, which refer to 0111(7),11011(B),1101(D),1110(E),111(F)
```c
bits==0x7 || bits==0xB || (bits>=0xD)
```
- ** reverse the byte order (i.e., produce val=0xFECA)**

Elaboration : `int val = 0xCAFE`<br />
The 1st byte(8-bit) is C, 1100 <br />
The 2nd byte(8-bit) is A, 1010 <br />
The 3rd byte(8-bit) is F, 1111 <br />
The 4th byte(8-bit) is E, 1110 <br />

The answer : 
```C
((0xFF&val)<<8)|(val>>8)
```
Which is the same as 
```C
((0x00FF&val)<<8)|(val>>8))
```

for `(0x00FF&val)` , it change the first 2 bit to **0** as `0 & 1` and `0 & 0` equals 0, and the last 2 bit remains **unchanged** as `1 & value` equals value.

- ** rotate fourbits (i.e., produce val=0xECAF)**

The answer:
```c
val = (val >> 4) | ((val&0xF)<<12)
```
This share the similar method with above question

#### Problem 2.4
**Using precedence rules, evaluate the following expressions and determine the value of the variables(without running the code). Also rewrite them using parenthesis to make the order explicit.**
- ** Assume (x=0xFF33,MASK=0xFF00).Expression: c=x & MASK ==0;**
- ** Assume (x=10,y=2,z=2;).Expression: z=y=x++ + ++y∗2;**
- ** Assume (x=10,y=4,z=1;).Expression: y>>= x&0x2 && z**

#### Problem 2.5
**Determine if the following statements have any errors. If so, highlight them and explain why.**
- ** int 2nd value=10;**

Variable name should be 2nd_value as no space is allowed for variable name.

- ** Assume (x=0,y=0,alliszero=1). alliszero =(x=1) && (y=0);**

No error, `alliszero =(x=1) && (y=0);` could be complie, the result is 0;

Model answer : `x = 1` and `y = 0`, should be replaced by `x==1` and `x==0`

- ** Assume (x=10,y=3,z=0;). y=++x+y;z=z−−>x;**

> is not a appropriate operator 

- ** Assume that we want to test if last four bits of x are on. (int MASK=0xF;ison=x&MASK==MASK)**

## Short summary of Lecture 2

#### Weakly type?

In slide 3, the powerpoint stated that C is a weakly typed language. I feel a bit strage and go for some research. I believe that **weakly typed ** is a subjective concept, which does not have an official definition of it.
The claims of C is a weakly typed language is mostly about C uses alot of pointer which will lead to memory leaks.

#### Bit operator 

## Other relevant meterial

Here is some relevant function in printing log in C.

In C++, we could simply do :
```cpp
cout << c << endl;
```
But in C:
we need to do 
```c
printf("%c\n",c);
```

Here are all other Special character,

- \n (newline)
- \t (tab)
- \v (vertical tab)
- \f (new page)
- \b (backspace)
- \r (carriage return)
- \n (newline)
Format Specifiers
- %i or %d(int)
- %c (char)
- %f	(float) 
- %s	(string)
