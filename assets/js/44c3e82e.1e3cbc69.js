This is to prevent the use of rainbow table for getting common password. \\r\\n\\r\\n[Rainbow table - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table)\\r\\n\\r\\nLearn a bit on MD5 algorithm, read a bit on SHA. \\r\\n\\r\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the paper about two Chinese professor, Tao Xie, Dengguo Feng, cracking MD5 hashing method in 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\n[https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/223.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/223.pdf)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Recommendations for beginners\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething good to play with if you are free at night for 1 hour and got nothing to do\\r\\n\\r\\n## Approach:\\r\\n\\r\\nI read all the material provided first, and search related page of hashing method mentioned in the material. MD5, SHA1,SHA2 . I believe the password are encrypted in such ways, so I find an online tool to crack it. \\r\\n\\r\\n[MD5 Decrypter - Password Hash Cipher (+Salt) - Online Decoder (dcode.fr)](https://www.dcode.fr/md5-hash)\\r\\n\\r\\nFunny enough, this are all password in the common password bank like qwerty,123456, so I could find the password out easily."},{"id":"/email-me","metadata":{"permalink":"/coding/email-me","source":"@site/Blogs/coding/email-me.md","title":"email-me","description":"","date":"2022-06-11T21:19:57.000Z","formattedDate":"June 11, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":0,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"prevItem":{"title":"Goldman Sachs virtual engineering program experience","permalink":"/coding/Goldman-sachs"},"nextItem":{"title":"Overview","permalink":"/coding/index"}},"content":""},{"id":"/index","metadata":{"permalink":"/coding/index","source":"@site/Blogs/coding/index.md","title":"Overview","description":"Overview","date":"2022-06-07T10:27:39.000Z","formattedDate":"June 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Overview","permalink":"/coding/tags/overview"}],"readingTime":0.1,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Overview","tags":["Overview"]},"prevItem":{"title":"email-me","permalink":"/coding/email-me"}},"content":"### Overview\\r\\n\\r\\nThis blog will include some research on interesting coding topic or markdown my journey of learning competitive programming."}]}')}}]);
